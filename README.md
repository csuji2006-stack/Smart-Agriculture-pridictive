# 🌾 Smart Agriculture – Predictive Irrigation System (Advanced)

An advanced Machine Learning and IoT-based system that predicts irrigation
requirements and optimal water quantity using simulated sensor data, real-time
MQTT streaming, feature engineering, and ensemble ML models.

This project follows an industry-style architecture using MQTT, FastAPI,
Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, making it suitable for final-year engineering
projects and real-world smart agriculture applications.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often over-irrigate crops due to the lack of predictive insights.
This project builds a predictive irrigation system that analyzes soil and
weather conditions to determine whether irrigation is required and how much
water should be supplied.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate real-time IoT sensor data
- Stream data using MQTT protocol
- Store sensor data reliably in a database
- Perform advanced feature engineering
- Train ensemble ML models for prediction
- Expose predictions via FastAPI REST services
- Visualize results using an interactive dashboard

## 🌐 Website & Deployment

This project includes a static website hosted on GitHub Pages that showcases the system.

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to `docs/` folder
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will build and deploy the site from the `docs/` folder
3. Access your site at: `https://yourusername.github.io/smart-agriculture`

### Running the Full Application
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start MQTT broker (Mosquitto)
3. Run data collector: `python backend_mqtt_subscriber.py`
4. Run API server: `uvicorn api:app --reload`
5. Run dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard.py`
